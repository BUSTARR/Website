    <h1>VERMICOMPOSTING</h1>

    <p class="paragraph">Vermicomposting is a natural process whereby earthworms convert waste material <br>
        with rigid structures into compost. The compost produced in this green process is <br>
        traditionally and popularly used as a natural fertilizer for enhancing plant growth. <br>
        Vermicompost (vermi-compost) is the product of the decomposition process using various <br>
        species of worms, usually red wigglers, white worms, and other earthworms, to create a mixture <br>
        of decomposing vegetable or food waste, bedding materials, and vermicast. This process <br>
        is called vermicomposting, while the rearing of worms for this purpose is called vermiculture. <br>
        Vermicast (also called worm castings, worm humus, worm manure, or worm faeces) is the end-product <br>
        of the breakdown of organic matter by earthworms. These excreta have been shown to contain </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        reduced levels of contaminants and a higher saturation of nutrients than the organic materials <br> 
        before vermicomposting. Vermicompost contains water-soluble nutrients and is an excellent, nutrient-rich <br>
        organic fertilizer and soil conditioner. It is used in gardening and sustainable, organic farming. <br>
        Vermicomposting can also be applied for treatment of sewage. A variation of the process is <br> 
        vermifiltration (or vermidigestion) which is used to remove organic matter, pathogens, and oxygen demand <br>
        from wastewater or directly from blackwater of flush toilets.
